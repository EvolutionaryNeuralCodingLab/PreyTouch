# Getting Started
## Access the User Interface
In order to open PreyTouch user interface, open any internet browser (we recommend using Mozilla Firefox) and go to:
```commandline
http://localhost:5084
```
In case you want to access PreyTouch from another computer on the same network as the server running PreyTouch, simply change "localhost" to the hostname of the server.

Changing the port number can be done using the environment variable: "MANAGEMENT_PORT"
